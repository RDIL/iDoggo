## Installing  
To install, first open up a terminal and type the following:

```  
You should then have the library on your computer!  

## Using  
To use, you need to add the following line to the top of any Python file you will be using the library in:  
```py  
import iDoggo  
```  
Then you can use any of the following commands:  
```py  
import iDoggo

# Dog1
dog = iDoggo.dog1()
print(dog)

# Dog2
dog2 = iDoggo.dog2()
print(dog2)

# Get package info:  
print(iDoggo.packageInfo())
```

And that should work.  Make sure to visit our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/TheICC/iDoggo/issues) if you find any bugs!
